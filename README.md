# Introduction


This is a code using PlotJS in Angular, for scientific computation.

# Getting started

Open VS code, or any tool of your preference.

`git clone https://github.com/JorgeGuerraPires/plotly-angular-scientific.git`

`npm i`

`ng serve -o`

It should start the app, working.
See that Angular is changing all the time, and it may happen problems with conflicts between packages. Just go to the package.json and force to install the package versions there. Either install manually or just eliminate the ^ symbols.
